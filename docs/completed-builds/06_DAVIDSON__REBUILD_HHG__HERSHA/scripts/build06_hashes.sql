-- Row count and content hash of this build's lanes' objects (DAVIDSON new;
-- HHG and HERSHA rebuilt): 12 staging tables (RUN_ID excluded), each lane's
-- rows in the classification table (LAST_SEEN_RUN_ID excluded), the 5
-- transformation streams per lane and each lane's slice of the six semantic
-- tables. Two consecutive runs must hash identically. 48 objects. Objects
-- not yet built (DAVIDSON before M3-M6) fail to compile: run only the lines
-- that exist at the milestone (see the milestone memo).
